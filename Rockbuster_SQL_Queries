1. This code snippet calculates the average total amount paid by customers from a specific set of cities ('London', 'Aurora', 'Vijayawada', 'Maikop', 'Hosiarpur', 'Nakhon Sawan', 'Bhimavram', 'Nam Dinh', 'Liaocheng', 'Yinchuan'). It uses subqueries to join multiple tables (customer, address, city, country, payment) and aggregates the data to calculate the average using the AVG function and rounding it with the ROUND function.

SELECT ROUND(AVG(total_amount_paid)) AS "average"
FROM (
  SELECT A.first_name AS customer_first_name,
         A.last_name AS customer_last_name,
         A.customer_id,
         D.country,
         C.city,
         SUM(E.amount) AS total_amount_paid
  FROM customer A
  INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
  INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
  INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
  INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id
  WHERE city IN ('London', 'Aurora', 'Vijayawada', 'Maikop', 'Hosiarpur', 'Nakhon Sawan', 'Bhimavram', 'Nam Dinh', 'Liaocheng', 'Yinchuan')
  GROUP BY country, city, A.customer_id, customer_first_name, customer_last_name
  ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC
  LIMIT 5
) AS total_amount_paid;

2. This code snippet retrieves the country-wise count of all customers and the count of customers who are in the top 5 based on their total amount paid. It uses a subquery (top_5_customers) to get the top 5 customers and joins it with the main query to perform the count. The results are grouped by country and ordered by the count of all customers.

SELECT D.country,
       COUNT(A.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
       COUNT(top_5_customers.customer_id) AS top_customer_count
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
LEFT JOIN (
  SELECT A.first_name AS customer_first_name,
         A.last_name AS customer_last_name,
         A.customer_id,
         D.country,
         C.city,
         SUM(E.amount) AS total_amount_paid
  FROM customer A
  INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
  INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
  INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
  INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id
  WHERE city IN ('London', 'Aurora', 'Vijayawada', 'Maikop', 'Hosiarpur', 'Nakhon Sawan', 'Bhimavram', 'Nam Dinh', 'Liaocheng', 'Yinchuan')
  GROUP BY country, city, A.customer_id, customer_first_name, customer_last_name
  ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC
  LIMIT 5
) AS top_5_customers ON A.customer_id = top_5_customers.customer_id
GROUP BY D.country
HAVING COUNT(top_5_customers.customer_id) > 0
ORDER BY all_customer_count DESC;

3. This code snippet calculates the average total amount paid by customers from the same set of cities as in the previous snippets. It uses a common table expression (CTE) named total_amount_paid to calculate the total amount paid by customers and then selects the average using the AVG function.

WITH total_amount_paid AS (
    SELECT A.first_name AS customer_first_name,
        A.last_name AS customer_last_name,
        A.customer_id,
        D.country,
        C.city,
        SUM(E.amount) AS total_amount_paid
    FROM customer A
    INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
    INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
    INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
    INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id
    WHERE city IN ('London', 'Aurora', 'Vijayawada', 'Maikop', 'Hosiarpur', 'Nakhon Sawan', 'Bhimavram', 'Nam Dinh', 'Liaocheng', 'Yinchuan')
    GROUP BY country, city, A.customer_id, customer_first_name, customer_last_name
    ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC
    LIMIT 5
)
SELECT ROUND(AVG(total_amount_paid)) AS "average"
FROM total_amount_paid;
